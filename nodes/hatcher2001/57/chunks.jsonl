Geometrically, the first solid torus S1(cid:2)D2 can be identified with the compact region in R3 bounded by the standard torus S1(cid:2)S1 containing K, and the second solid torus D2(cid:2)S1 is then the closureofthecomplementofthefirstsolidtorus,togetherwiththecompactification pointatinfinity. Noticethatmeridionalcirclesin S1(cid:2)S1 bounddisksinthefirstsolid torus,whileitislongitudinalcirclesthatbounddisksinthesecondsolidtorus. In the first solid torus, K intersects each of the meridian K circles fxg(cid:2)@D2 in m equally spaced points, as indicated in the figure at the right, which shows a meridian disk fxg(cid:2)D2. These m points can be separated by a union of m radial line segments. Letting x vary,theseradialsegmentsthentraceout K K acopyofthemappingcylinder X inthefirstsolidtorus.

In similar fashion the complement of K in the secondsolidtorusdeformationretractsonto X . Thesetwodeformationretractions n do not agree on their common domain of definition S1(cid:2)S1\u2212K, but this is easy to correct by distorting the flows in the two solid tori so that in S1(cid:2)S1\u2212K both flows areorthogonalto K. Afterthismodificationwenowhaveawell-defineddeformation retraction of S3 \u2212K onto X. Another way of describing the situation would be to saythatforanopen \" neighborhood N of K boundedbyatorus T,thecomplement ! S3\u2212N isthemappingcylinderofamap T X. To compute (cid:25) (cid:132)X(cid:133) we apply van Kampen\u2019s theorem to the decomposition of X 1 as the union of X and X , or more properly, open neighborhoods of these two m n sets that deformation retract onto them. Both X and X are mapping cylinders m n that deformation retract onto circles, and X \\X is a circle, so all three of these m n spaces have fundamental group Z.
