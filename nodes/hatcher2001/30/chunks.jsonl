But this machinery also has acertainintrinsicbeauty. This first chapter introduces one of the simplest and most important functors of algebraic topology, the fundamental group, which creates an algebraic image of a space from the loops in the space, the paths in the space starting and ending at the samepoint. The Idea of the Fundamental Group To get a feeling for what the fundamental group is about, let us look at a few preliminaryexamplesbeforegivingtheformaldefinitions.", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "30"}}
