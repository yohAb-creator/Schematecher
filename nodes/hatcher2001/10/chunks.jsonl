To take an everyday example, the letters of the alphabet can be writ- ten either as unions of finitely many straightandcurvedlinesegments,or in thickened forms that are compact subsurfaces of the plane bounded by simpleclosedcurves. Ineachcasethe thin letter is a subspace of the thick letter, andwecancontinuouslyshrinkthethicklettertothethinone. Anicewayto do this is to decompose a thick letter, call it X, into line segments connecting each point on the outer boundary of X to a unique point of the thin subletter X, as indi- cated inthe figure. Thenwecan shrink X to X by sliding eachpoint of X\u2212X into X alongthelinesegmentthatcontainsit. Pointsthatarealreadyin X donotmove.
