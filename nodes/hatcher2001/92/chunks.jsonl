By definition, a graph is a 1 dimensional CW complex, in other words, a space X obtained from a discrete set X0 by attaching a collection of 1 cells e . Thus X (cid:11) isobtainedfromthedisjointunionof X0 withclosedintervals I byidentifyingthe (cid:11) two endpoints of each I with points of X0. The points of X0 are the vertices and (cid:11) the 1 cellstheedgesof X. Notethatwiththisdefinitionanedgedoesnotincludeits endpoints, so an edge is an open subset of X. The two endpoints of an edge can be thesamevertex,sotheclosure e ofanedge e ishomeomorphiceitherto I or S1.

This is true in particular if the edges containing the sequence all have a common vertex and one tries to choose the sequence so that it gets \u2018closer and closer\u2019 to the vertex. Thus if there is a vertex that is the endpoint of infinitely many edges, then the weak topology cannot be a metric topology.
