In Example 1.35 we constructed a contractible 2 complex X e (cid:131) m;n T (cid:2)R as the universal cover of a finite 2 complex X that was the union of m;n m;n the mapping cylinders of the two maps S1 ! S1, z , zm and z , zn. The group of deck transformations of this covering space is therefore the fundamental group (cid:25) (cid:132)X (cid:133). From van Kampen\u2019s theorem applied to the decomposition of X into 1 m;n (cid:10) (cid:11) m;n the two mapping cylinders we have the presentation a;b jjjjamb \u2212n for this group G (cid:131)(cid:25) (cid:132)X (cid:133). Itisinterestingtolookattheactionof G on X e moreclosely. m;n 1 m;n m;n m;n e We described a decomposition of X into rectangles, with X the quotient of m;n m;n e one rectangle. These rectangles in fact define a cell structure on X lifting a cell m;n structureon X withtwovertices,threeedges,andone 2 cell. Thegroup G is m;n m;n e thusagroupofsymmetriesofthiscellstructureon X . Ifweorientthethreeedges m;n e of X andlifttheseorientationstotheedgesof X ,then G isthegroupofall m;n m;n m;n e symmetriesof X preservingtheorientationsofedges.

This means that there are actions of G on T m;n m;n m;n and R such that the action on the product X (cid:131) T (cid:2)R is the diagonal action (cid:0) (cid:1) m;n m;n g(cid:132)x;y(cid:133)(cid:131) g(cid:132)x(cid:133);g(cid:132)y(cid:133) for g2G . Ifwemaketherectanglesofunitheightinthe m;n R coordinate, thentheelement am (cid:131)bn actson R asunittranslation, while a acts by1= translationand b by1= translation. Thetranslationactionsof a and b on R m n generate a group of translations of R that is infinite cyclic, generated by translation bythereciprocaloftheleastcommonmultipleof m and n. The action of G on T has kernel consisting of the powers of the element m;n m;n am (cid:131) bn. This infinite cyclic subgroup is precisely the center of G , as we saw in m;n Example 1.24. There is an induced action of the quotient group Z (cid:3)Z on T , m n m;n but this is not a free action since the elements a and b and all their conjugates fix vertices of T . On the other hand, if we restrict the action of G on T to m;n m;n m;n ! the kernel K of the map G Z given by the action of G on the R factor of m;n m;n X , then we do obtain a free action of K on T . Since this action takes vertices m;n m;n toverticesandedgestoedges,itisacoveringspaceaction,so K isafreegroup,the fundamental group of the graph T =K. An exercise at the end of the section is to m;n determine T =K explicitlyandcomputethenumberofgeneratorsof K. m;n", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "85"}}
