Suppose a space Y is obtained from a path-connected subspace X by attaching n cells for a fixed n (cid:21) 3. Show that the inclusion X > Y induces an isomorphism on (cid:25) .

Let X be the quotient space of S2 obtained by identifying the north and south poles to a single point. Put a cell complex structure on X and use this to compute (cid:25) (cid:132)X(cid:133). 1 8.
