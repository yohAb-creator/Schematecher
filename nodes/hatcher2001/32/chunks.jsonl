We canredrawthepicturebypulling A and B apart,dragging C along,andthenwesee C winding back and forth between A and B as shown in the second figure above. In this new position, if we start at the point of C indicated by the dot and proceed in the direction given by the arrow, then we pass in sequence: (1) forward through A, (2) forward through B, (3) backward through A, and (4) backward through B. If we measure the linking of C with A and B by two integers, then the \u2018forwards\u2019 and \u2018backwards\u2019 cancel and both integers are zero. This reflects the fact that C is not linkedwith A or B individually. To get a more accurate measure of how C links with A and B together, we re- gard the four parts (1)\u2013(4) of C as an ordered sequence.
