Moregenerally,anorientablesurface M ofgenus g canbeconstructed g fromapolygonwith4g sides a byidentifyingpairsofedges, as shown in the figure in the b b first three cases g (cid:131) 1;2;3. b a The 4g edgesofthepolygon a c becomeaunionof 2g circles d b in the surface, all intersect- b c ing in a single point. The in- c a terior of the polygon can be a d d b thought of as an open disk, a c or a 2 cell, attached to the d d union of the 2g circles. One e c c d can also regard the union of b e f b the circles as being obtained from their common point of e a intersection,byattaching 2g a f f a b open arcs, or 1 cells. Thus the surface can be built up in stages: Start with a point, attach 1 cells to this point, thenattacha 2 cell. Anaturalgeneralizationofthisistoconstructaspacebythefollowingprocedure: (1) Startwithadiscreteset X0,whosepointsareregardedas 0 cells. (2) Inductively,formthen skeleton Xn from Xn\u22121 byattaching n cells en viamaps (cid:11) \u2019 :Sn\u22121 ! Xn\u22121. Thismeansthat Xn isthequotientspaceofthedisjointunion (cid:11) \u2018 Xn\u22121 Dn of Xn\u22121 with a collection of n disks Dn under the identifications (cid:11) (cid:11) (cid:11)\u2018 x (cid:24) \u2019 (cid:132)x(cid:133) for x 2 @Dn. Thus as a set, Xn (cid:131) Xn\u22121 en where each en is an (cid:11) (cid:11) (cid:11) (cid:11) (cid:11) open n disk. (3) One can either stop this inductive process at a finite stage, setting X (cid:131) Xn for S some n < 1, or one can continue indefinitely, setting X (cid:131) Xn. In the latter n case X isgiventheweaktopology: Aset A(cid:26)X isopen(orclosed)iff A\\Xn is open(orclosed)in Xn foreach n. A space X constructed in this way is called a cell complex or CW complex. The explanation of the letters \u2018CW\u2019 is given in the Appendix, where a number of basic topological properties of cell complexes are proved.
