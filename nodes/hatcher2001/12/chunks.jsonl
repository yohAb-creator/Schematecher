A deformation retraction f :X X is a special case of the general notion of a t ! homotopy,whichissimplyanyfamilyofmaps f :X Y, t 2I,suchthattheasso- t ! ciated map F:X(cid:2)I Y given by F(cid:132)x;t(cid:133) (cid:131) f (cid:132)x(cid:133) is continuous. One says that two t ! maps f ;f :X Y are homotopic if there exists a homotopy f connecting them, 0 1 t andonewrites f \u2019f . 0 1 Intheseterms,adeformationretractionof X ontoasubspace A isahomotopy ! from the identity map of X to a retraction of X onto A, a map r:X X such that r(cid:132)X(cid:133) (cid:131) A and r jjA (cid:131) 11.

Retractionsarethetopologicalanalogsofprojectionoperators inotherpartsofmathematics. Not all retractions come from deformation retractions. For example, a space X always retracts onto any point x 2X via the constant map sending all of X to x , 0 0 but a space that deformation retracts onto a point must be path-connected since a deformation retraction of X to x gives a path joining each x 2 X to x . It is less 0 0 trivial to show that there are path-connected spaces that do not deformation retract onto a point. One would expect this to be the case for the letters \u2018with holes,\u2019 A, B, D, O, P, Q, R. InChapter1wewilldeveloptechniquestoprovethis. ! Ahomotopy f :X X thatgivesadeformationretractionof X ontoasubspace t A hasthepropertythat f jjA(cid:131)11 forall t. Ingeneral,ahomotopy f :X ! Y whose t t restriction to a subspace A (cid:26) X is independent of t is called a homotopy relative to A,ormoreconcisely,ahomotopy rel A. Thus,adeformationretractionof X onto A isahomotopy relA fromtheidentitymapof X toaretractionof X onto A. ! If a space X deformation retracts onto a subspace A via f :X X, then if t ! ! r:X A denotestheresultingretractionand i:A X theinclusion,wehave ri(cid:131)11 and ir \u2019 11, the latter homotopy being given by f .

Itisaneasyexercisetocheck that this is an equivalence relation, in contrast with the nonsymmetric notion of de- formationretraction.
