Thethreegraphs arehomotopyequivalentsince each is a deformation retract of a disk with two holes, but we can also deduce this from the collapsing criterion above since collapsing the middle edge of the first and thirdgraphsproducesthesecondgraph.

Thissimplificationcan be repeated until all edges of X are loops, and then each component of X is either anisolatedvertexorawedgesumofcircles. This raises the question of whether two such graphs, having only one vertex in each component, can be homotopy equivalent if they are not in fact just isomorphic graphs. Exercise 12 at the end of the chapter reduces the question to the case of W connectedgraphs. Thenthetaskistoprovethatawedgesum S1 ofmcirclesisnot W m homotopyequivalentto S1 if m(cid:148)n.
