Example 0.1. A 1 dimensional cell complex X (cid:131) X1 is what is called a graph in algebraictopology. Itconsistsofvertices(the 0 cells)towhichedges(the 1 cells)are attached. Thetwoendsofanedgecanbeattachedtothesamevertex. Example 0.2. The house with two rooms, pictured earlier, has a visually obvious 2 dimensionalcellcomplexstructure. The0 cellsaretheverticeswherethreeormore ofthedepictededgesmeet,andthe 1 cellsaretheinteriorsoftheedgesconnecting these vertices. This gives the 1 skeleton X1, and the 2 cells are the components of theremainderofthespace, X\u2212X1.

Thisis the Euler characteristic, which for a cell complex with finitely many cells is defined to be the number of even-dimensional cells minus the number of odd-dimensional cells. As we shall show in Theorem 2.44, the Euler characteristic of a cell complex dependsonlyonitshomotopytype,sothefactthatthehousewithtworoomshasthe homotopy type of a point implies that its Euler characteristic must be 1, no matter howitisrepresentedasacellcomplex.

Example 0.4. Real projective n space RPn is defined to be the space of all lines throughtheoriginin Rn(cid:130)1. Eachsuchlineisdeterminedbyanonzerovectorin Rn(cid:130)1, unique up to scalar multiplication, and RPn is topologized as the quotient space of Rn(cid:130)1\u2212f0g undertheequivalencerelation v (cid:24)(cid:21)v forscalars (cid:21)(cid:148)0. Wecanrestrict to vectors of length 1, so RPn is also the quotient space Sn=(cid:132)v (cid:24) \u2212v(cid:133), the sphere withantipodalpointsidentified.
