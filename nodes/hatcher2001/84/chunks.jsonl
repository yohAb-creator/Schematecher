We will show in Proposition 2.29 that Z is the only 2 possibility when n is even, but for odd n the question is much more difficult.

The orbit space S2k\u22121=Z is one of a family of spaces called lens spaces m definedinExample2.43. There are also noncyclic finite groups that act freely as rotations of Sn for odd n > 1. These actions are classified quite explicitly in [Wolf 1984]. Examples in the simplestcasen(cid:131)3canbeproducedasfollows. ViewR4 asthequaternionalgebraH. Multiplication of quaternions satisfies jabj (cid:131) jajjbj where jaj denotes the usual Euclideanlengthofavector a2R4. Thusif a and b areunitvectors,sois ab,and ! hence quaternion multiplication defines a map S3(cid:2)S3 S3. This in fact makes S3 into a group, though associativity is all we need now since associativity implies that any subgroup G of S3 acts on S3 by left-multiplication, g(cid:132)x(cid:133) (cid:131) gx. This action is freesinceanequation x (cid:131)gx inthedivisionalgebra H implies g (cid:131)1 or x (cid:131)0.
