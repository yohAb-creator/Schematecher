{"chunk_id": "31-0", "text": "22 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Consider two linked circles A and B in R3, as shown in the figure. Our experience with actual links and chains tells us that since the two circles are linked, it is impossi- ble to separate B from A by any continuous motion of B, A B such as pushing, pulling, or twisting. We could even take B to be made of rubber or stretchable string and allow completely general continu- ous deformations of B, staying in the complement of A at all times, and it would still be impossible to pull B off A. At least that is what intuition suggests, and the fundamentalgroupwillgiveawayofmakingthisintuitionmathematicallyrigorous. Instead of having B link with A just once, we could makeitlinkwithAtwoormoretimes,asinthefigurestothe right.

Can the group operation be mimicked geometrically with some sort of addition op- eration on the oriented circles B linking A? An oriented circle B can be thought of as a path traversed in time, starting and ending at the same point x , which we 0 can choose to be any point on the circle. Such a path starting and ending at the 0 same point is called a loop. Two different loops B and B both starting and end- ing at the same point x can be \u2018added\u2019 to form a new loop B(cid:130)B 0 that travels first 0 0 0 around B,thenaround B .
