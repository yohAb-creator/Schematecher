{"chunk_id": "3.2.9-0", "text": "Chapter 3. Homology Introduction to TDA Consider the space you get when you simultaneously pierce a balloon at n distinct locations. What is the homology of this space? Exercise 3.50. Let f,g : S1 \u2192 S1 be continuous maps such that f(\u2212x) = f(x) and g(\u2212x) = \u2212g(x) for all x \u2208 S1. a) Convince yourself that f : H (S1) \u2192 H (S1) is trivial (maps everything to 0) \u2217 1 1 and that g is an isomorphism. \u2217 b) Show that f and g are not homotopic. c) Show that there is no map h : S2 \u2192 S1 such that h(\u2212x) = \u2212h(x). d) Conclude that every map \u03d5 : S2 \u2192 R2 with \u03d5(\u2212x) = \u2212\u03d5(x) has a zero. The statement you have proven in d) is equivalent to the 2-dimensional case of the famous Borsuk-Ulam theorem, which implies statements such as \u201cat any time, there are two antipodal points on the earth with both the same temperature and atmospheric pressure\u201d. 3.2.9 Application: Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem In this section we finally collect the fruits of our hard work by using homology to give a relatively short proof of the famous fixed point theorem by Brouwer. Here, Bd denotes the unit ball of dimension d. Theorem 3.51 (Brouwer fixed point theorem). Let f : Bd \u2192 Bd be continuous. Then, f has a fixed point, that is, \u2203x \u2208 Bd such that f(x) = x. This theorem has many fascinating implications: \u2022 Take two sheets of paper lying on top of each other. Crumple the top sheet and set it back onto the other sheet. No matter how you crumpled the sheet, at least one point of the crumpled sheet lies exactly above its corresponding point in the bottom sheet. \u2022 If you open a map of Switzerland in Switzerland, there is at least one point on the map which is at its exact position.2 \u2022 If you take a cup of liquid and stir or slosh it, at least one atom ends up at its original position (but if you shake you might break continuity). \u2022 The theorem also has many applications in mathematics and computer science, such as in fair divisions or for proving existence of Nash equilibria. 2The theorem only applies when ignoring the Italian and German exclaves of Campione d\u2019Italia and B\u00fcsingen am Hochrhein. 44 Introduction to TDA 3.2. Homology ToproveTheorem3.51,wefirstintroducethefollowingdefinitionandahelperlemma, which we only prove after proving Theorem 3.51 itself. Definition 3.52. A map r : X \u2192 A \u2286 X is a retraction if r(a) = a, \u2200a \u2208 A. Lemma 3.53. There is no retraction r : Bd \u2192 Sd\u22121. Proof of Theorem 3.51. We prove the theorem by contradiction. For an illustration of the argument see Figure 3.11. Assume f : Bd \u2192 Bd has no fixed point. For each \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 x, consider the ray f(x)x and let r(x) be the intersection of this ray with Sd\u22121. Then, r : Bd \u2192 Sd\u22121 is continuous (which we do not prove here) and r(s) = s \u2200s \u2208 Sd\u22121, since \u2212\u2212\u2192 no matter where f(s) lies, f(s)s first intersects Sd\u22121 in s. Thus, r is a retraction, which does not exist by Lemma 3.53. f(x) x r(x) Figure 3.11: If f has no fixed point, we get a retraction to the boundary. It remains to prove the helper lemma. Proof of Lemma 3.53. Consider the inclusion map i : Sd\u22121 (cid:44)\u2192 Bd, and a retraction r : Bd \u2192 Sd\u22121. By definition, we have r \u25e6 i = id.

Let us look at the induced maps \u223c of r and i in the (d \u2212 1)-th homology of Sd\u22121 and Bd. Recall that H (Sd\u22121) = Z d\u22121 2 \u223c and H (Bd) = 0. We thus view i as a homomorphism from Z to 0, and r as a d\u22121 \u2217 2 \u2217 homomorphism from 0 to Z . But since r \u25e6 i = id, we also have r \u25e6 i = id. We can 2 \u2217 \u2217 combine this to reach a contradiction: 1 = id(1) = (r \u25e6i )(1) = r (i (1)) = r (0) = 0 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 Thus, either i or r cannot exist, but since i exists, r cannot. 45 Chapter 3.
