The (d\u22121)-simplex that is a boundary of both \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032 would then be part of \u03b4 (c\u2032). We conclude that Z (Sd) = \u27e8c\u27e9. p d Since \u03b4(\u2206d+1) is a d-dimensional simplicial complex, and thus does not contain any (d+1)-simplices, no non-empty d-chain can be a boundary. We thus get that B (Sd) is d the group containing only 0. \u223c We finally get H (Sd) = Z /B = Z = Z . d d d d 2 (cid:80) H (Sd): Finally, let us go to H (Sd), for 0 < p < d: Let c = \u03b1 \u03c3 be a p-cycle. We p p i i aim to show that c is homologous to the 0-chain, i.e., that [c] = [0]. Equivalently, we show that c must be a boundary. Let \u03c3 = (v ,...,v ) be any p-simplex in c which does not include v . We will m 0 mp 0 keep replacing such simplices by simplices which do contain v , until we have no more 0 simplices not containing v . 0 Let b be the (p+1)-simplex (v ,v ,...,v ). Note that b \u2208 \u03b4(\u2206d+1) and thus \u03b4(b) 0 m 0 mp is a p-boundary. Also note that \u03c3 is in \u03b4(b). Furthermore, \u03c3 is the only p-simplex in \u03b4(b) which does not contain v . We now add \u03b4(b) to c, to get c\u2032 := c+\u03b4(b). Since we 0 added a boundary, [c] = [c\u2032] (i.e., c and c\u2032 are homologous). Furthermore, c\u2032 contains one fewer p-simplex not containing v , when compared to c. 0 We repeat this process until we reach a cycle c\u2217 in which every p-simplex contains v . We now claim that c\u2217 must be the trivial cycle: Assume c\u2217 contains some p-simplex 0 a = (v ,v ,...,v ). Then, the (p\u22121)-simplex a\u2032 = (v ,...,v ) is part of \u03b4(a). But, 0 a 1 ap a 1 ap a\u2032 cannot be part of the boundary of any other p-simplex in c\u2217, since the only p-simplex containing a\u2032 as a face while also containing v is a. Thus, to have an empty boundary, 0 we have c\u2217 = 0. By construction, [c] = [c\u2217], therefore [c] = 0 as we aimed to prove. We have proven that every cycle is homologous to 0, and we can conclude that for all 0 < p < d, H (Sd) = 0. p Since Sd is d-dimensional, we do not have any simplices of dimensions p > d, and thus H (Sd) = 0 for p > d. Combining all these arguments we conclude the following p theorem: Theorem 3.39. For any d > 0, we have (cid:14) Z p \u2208 {0,d} H (Sd) = 2 p 0 else. (cid:14) 1 p \u2208 {0,d} \u03b2 (Sd) = p 0 else. 3.2.8 Induced Homology As usual, now that we have defined some mathematical objects (homology groups) we are also interested in the maps between them. For simplicial complexes we have defined 41 Chapter 3. Homology Introduction to TDA simplicial maps, and we now want to study the effect that simplicial maps have on the homology of a space. We first extend simplicial maps to the chain groups. Definition 3.40. Let f : K \u2192 K be a simplicial map. This induces a chain map 1 2 f : C (K ) \u2192 C (K ) # p 1 p 2 (cid:14) (cid:88) (cid:88) f(\u03c3 ) if f(\u03c3 ) is p-simplex in K i i 2 c = \u03b1", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "3.2.8"}}

This also gives us the option to compute the homology of a space by computing the homology of a potentially simpler homotopy equivalent space. Corollary 3.48. If f : X \u2192 Y is a homotopy equivalence (i.e., there exists g : Y \u2192 X such that f \u25e6 g is homotopic to id and g \u25e6 f is homotopic to id ), then f is an Y X \u2217 isomorphism. Proof.
