We first want to define p-chains, which are simply an algebraic way of formalizing and generalizing subsets of p-simplices. Definition 3.17. A p-chain c (in K) is a formal sum of p-simplices added with some coefficients from some ring R. A p-chain c can thus be written as (cid:88)mp c = \u03b1 \u03c3 , i i i=1 where \u03b1 \u2208 R and \u03c3 \u2208 K are p-simplices. i i All we are doing in this formal sum is giving a coefficient from R to each p-simplex of K. A formal sum is only a sum in a syntactic sense (i.e., we use the symbols + (cid:80) and ), but there is no semantic meaning behind this operation; there is no other way to represent a chain other than the sum it is defined by. Using the addition operation of the ring R however, we can now also add two p-chains (cid:80) (cid:80) c = \u03b1 \u03c3 and c\u2032 = \u03b1\u2032\u03c3 (both in K). Since the chains are both just formal sums, i i i i we can simply do this addition \u201ccomponent-wise\u201d, using addition in R on the coefficients: (cid:88)mp c+c\u2032 := (\u03b1 +\u03b1\u2032)\u03c3 i i i i=1 We therefore have an addition operation on the set C (K) of all p-chains in K. We p show next that C (K) endowed with this operation forms a group, and we call it the p p-th chain group (of K). Observation 3.18. (C (K),+) is an abelian group, it is free, and the p-simplices form p a basis. Proof. To show that it is a group we observe that: 1. C (K) is closed under addition, since \u2200c ,c \u2208 C (K) we have c +c \u2208 C (K). p 1 2 p 1 2 p 2. The operation + is associative: \u2200c ,c ,c \u2208 C (K), (cid:80) 1 (cid:80)2 3 p (cid:80) (c +c )+c = (\u03b1(1) +\u03b1(2))\u03c3 + \u03b1(3)\u03c3 = (\u03b1(1) +\u03b1(2) +\u03b1(3))\u03c3 = (cid:80)1 2 (cid:80)3 i i i i i i i i i \u03b1(1)\u03c3 + (\u03b1(2) +\u03b1(3))\u03c3 = c +(c +c ). i i i i i 1 2 3 (cid:80) 3.

Every element has an inverse: \u2200c \u2208 C (K) we have \u2212c = (\u2212\u03b1 \u03c3 ) \u2208 C (K) and (cid:80) p i i p c+(\u2212c) = (\u03b1 \u2212\u03b1 )\u03c3 = 0. i i i 33", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "3.2.1"}}
