We consider persistence modules over of vector spaces over some field . We start by R F looking at some special persistence modules, called interval modules. Definition 6.32. An interval module I[b,d] is a persistence module (cid:14) (cid:14) F if a \u2208 [b,d], id b \u2a7d a \u2a7d a\u2032 \u2a7d d, V = and v = a a,a\u2032 0 otherwise. 0 otherwise. Similarly, we can define interval modules on open and clopen intervals, denoted by I(b,d), I(b,d], and I[b,d). We write I\u27e8b,d\u27e9 to include all four of these types. Foranintervalmodulewecaneasilytalkaboutbirthanddeathaswedidinpersistent homology. If we have a persistent homology module that is (isomorphic to) an interval module, the birth and death correspond to the boundaries b,d of the interval. Definition 6.33. A persistence module U is called pointwise finite dimensional (p.f.d.) if for all a \u2208 R, U has finite dimension. a Note that all p.f.d. persistence modules are also q-tame. Definition 6.34. Given two persistence modules U,V, we define their direct sum U\u2295V by (U\u2295V) = U \u2295V and (u\u2295v) = u \u2295v . a a a a,a\u2032 a,a\u2032 a,a\u2032 Here, the direct sum of maps just means applying the respective maps component- wise. Proposition6.35. If U ,U are \u03f5-interleaved, and V ,V are \u03b4-interleaved, then U \u2295V 1 2 1 2 1 1 and U \u2295V are max{\u03f5,\u03b4}-interleaved. 2 2 Proof. Without loss of generality, let \u03f5 \u2a7e \u03b4, so we need to show that they are \u03f5- interleaved. Recall that if two persistence modules are \u03b4-interleaved, they are also \u03f5- interleaved. Let \u03c6u,\u03c8u be (series of) functions showing that U ,U are \u03f5-interleaved. 1 2 Similarly, let \u03c6v,\u03c8v be (series of) functions showing that V ,V are \u03f5-interleaved. Then, 1 2 \u03c6u \u2295\u03c6v,\u03c8u \u2295\u03c8v show that U \u2295V and U \u2295V are \u03f5-interleaved. 1 1 2 2 72 Introduction to TDA 6.3. Interval Decomposition of Persistence Modules If we now have a direct sum of interval modules, we can still nicely talk about births and deaths: we just consider each interval module in isolation. The following theorem shows that surprisingly most persistence modules can be expressed as direct sums of interval modules. Theorem6.36(Structure theorem). Any p.f.d. persistence module decomposes uniquely into interval modules, i.e., we have \u223c (cid:77) U = I\u27e8b ,d \u27e9. i i i\u2208I The intervals \u27e8b ,d \u27e9 are exactly the barcodes if U is a persistent homology module. i i Note that unless we have some additional tame-ness condition on U , I is not guaran- teed to be finite. Recall that when we talked about persistent homology, we said that there is some consistent global choice of basis for persistent homology groups. That is a consequence of the structure theorem. The structure theorem also allows us to prove one direction of Theorem 6.26, which we will do in the following. Proposition 6.37. Consider two interval modules I = I\u27e8b ,d \u27e9 and I = I\u27e8b ,d \u27e9. 1 1 1 2 2 2 Then, d (I ,I ) = d (DgmI ,DgmI ). I 1 2 b 1 2 Proof.

Consider two interval modules I = I\u27e8b ,d \u27e9 and I = I\u27e8b ,d \u27e9. 1 1 1 2 2 2 Then, d (I ,I ) = d (DgmI ,DgmI ). I 1 2 b 1 2 Proof. To prove that d (I ,I ) \u2a7e d (DgmI ,DgmI ), we show that every upper bound I 1 2 b 1 2 ond isalsoanupperboundond : assumethatwehavemaps\u03c6,\u03c8showingthatthetwo I b modules are \u03f5-interleaved. Then, consider \u03c8 \u25e6\u03c6 = v1 , equality holding because a+\u03f5 a a,a+2\u03f5 \u03c6,\u03c8 certify \u03f5-interleaving and the triangular diagram commutes. Consider a \u2208 \u27e8b ,d \u27e9. 1 1 Case 1: v1 = 0 for all a \u2208 \u27e8b ,d \u27e9. Then, d \u2212b < 2\u03f5, and the (infinity-norm) a,a+2\u03f5 1 1 1 1 distance of (b ,d ) to the diagonal is less than \u03f5. If this case would also hold for v2 1 1 we would be done, since for both DgmI and DgmI we could match the point to the 1 2 diagonal. Case 2: v1 = id for some a \u2208 \u27e8b ,d \u27e9. Then, d \u2212b \u2a7e 2\u03f5. Furthermore, we have a,a+2\u03f5 1 1 1 1 \u03c6 (F) = F for all a \u2208 \u27e8b ,d \u22122\u03f5\u27e9.

Distances and Stability Introduction to TDA Case 1: The two off-diagonal points are matched to the diagonal. Then, we get that d \u2212b \u2a7d 2\u03f5 for both of them, and thus for all \u03f5\u2032 > \u03f5, I and I are \u03f5\u2032-interleaved with i i 1 2 \u03c6,\u03c8 = 0 (recall Exercise 6.22). Thus, d \u2a7d \u03f5. I Case 2: The points are matched with each other. Then, |b \u2212b | \u2a7d \u03f5 and |d \u2212d | \u2a7d \u03f5. 2 1 2 1 Taking \u03c6,\u03c8 = id we can see that I and I are \u03f5-interleaved.

Then we have that d (U,V) \u2a7d I d (DgmU,DgmV). b Proof. We apply the structure theorem to decompose U,V into direct sums of interval modules, i.e., U = (cid:76) I\u27e8b ,d \u27e9 \u2295 (cid:76) 0 and V = (cid:76) 0 \u2295 (cid:76) I\u27e8b ,d \u27e9.
