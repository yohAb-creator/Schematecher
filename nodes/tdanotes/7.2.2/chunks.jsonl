Distances for Reeb Graphs 7.2.2 Functional Distortion Distance As mentioned above, the functional distortion distance is motivated by the Gromov- Hausdorff distance for metric spaces. Thus, the first step is to define a metric on a single Reeb graph. Definition 7.24. Let R be a Reeb graph of a space X, and u,v \u2208 R (in the same f f connected component of R ), and let \u03c0 be a path from u to v. We define the height f of \u03c0 as height(\u03c0) = max f(x)\u2212min f(x). To turn this into a distance metric, x\u2208\u03c0 x\u2208\u03c0 we consider \u03a0(u,v),the set of all paths between u and v. Then, the function induced metric on R is defined as f d (u,v) = min height(\u03c0). f \u03c0\u2208\u03a0(u,v) In a sense, d (u,v) is the \u201cthickness\u201d of the thinnest \u201cslice\u201d of the space X in which u f and v are connected. Definition 7.25 (Functional distortion distance). Let R and R be two Reeb graphs. Let f g \u03a6 : R \u2192 R , \u03a8 : R \u2192 R be continuous functions, but not necessarily function- f g g f preserving. Then, we define correspondence and distortion: C(\u03a6,\u03a8) = {(x,y) \u2208 R \u00d7R | \u03a6(x) = y or x = \u03a8(y)} f g 1 D(\u03a6,\u03a8) = sup |d (x,x\u2032)\u2212d (y,y\u2032)|. f g 2 (x,y),(x\u2032,y\u2032)\u2208C(\u03a6,\u03a8) And finally, we define the functional distortion distance, d (R ,R ) = inf max{D(\u03a6,\u03a8),||f\u2212(g\u25e6\u03a6)|| ,||g\u2212(f\u25e6\u03a8)|| }. FD f g \u221e \u221e \u03a6,\u03a8 Also for this distance measure there is a stability theorem. Theorem 7.26. Let f,g : X \u2192 R be tame functions. Then, d FD (R f ,R g ) \u2a7d ||f\u2212g|| \u221e . We can also quantify the relation between the two discussed distances. Theorem 7.27. d (R ,R ) \u2a7d d (R ,R ) \u2a7d 3d (R ,R ). I f g FD f g I f g Exercise 7.28. Consider a merge tree T with regards to a function f. We define the a-shift xa for any x \u2208 T to be the unique \u201cancestor\u201d of x with function value f(xa) = f(x)+a. We now consider two merge trees; T with regards to f, and T with regards to 1 2 g. We call T and T \u03f5-compatible if there exist maps \u03b1 : T \u2192 T and \u03b2 : T \u2192 T 1 2 1 2 2 1 such that we get the following commutativities: \u2022 g(\u03b1(x)) = f(x)+\u03f5 for all x \u2208 T 1 83", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "7.2.2"}}
