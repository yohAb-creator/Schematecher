The Mapper M(U ,f ) consists \u221e 1 1 of an empty octahedron, with additional filled tetrahedra attached at the purple vertices. The whole space thus collapses to an octahedron. Algorithm: Since at the moment we only have a discrete metric space, we do not really have the notion of connected components yet. For every U \u2208 U, we thus cluster the pre- image f\u22121(U) using some clustering algorithm, which we can also consider as an input. Now, we can just consider each cluster C as a vertex of some simplicial complex K, and i add a face {C ,...,C } to K if these clusters (which are just point sets) have a common 1 k point. Output: We output K, or even just its 1-skeleton. As you can see, this algorithm requires a lot of input parameters. While this allows to encode previous knowledge of the data set (e.g. by choosing as filter function the distance to a known center of the data), it also makes the space of possible outputs very large. Picking the correct parameters is currently still an art form on its own, and there is significant research being done towards understanding the interplay between the parameters and statistical guarantees for certain good choices of parameters. 7.4 Multiscale Mapper Motivated by the many tuneable parameters, we discuss here one idea to look at many values at once. The multiscale Mapper is a combination of the ideas of persistence and of Mapper. We here want to look at different covers. Definition 7.32. Let U = {U } and F = {V } be two covers of the same space X. \u03b1 \u03b1\u2208A \u03b2 \u03b2\u2208B A map of covers is a map \u03c6 : A \u2192 B such that for every \u03b1 \u2208 A, we have U \u2286 V . \u03b1 \u03c6(\u03b1) 86 Introduction to TDA 7.4. Multiscale Mapper Proposition 7.33. If \u03c6 : U \u2192 V is a map of covers (with a slight abuse of notation), then the map N(\u03c6) : N(U) \u2192 N(V) given on the vertices by \u03c6 is simplicial. Proof. Let \u03c3 \u2208 N(U). We need to show that the intersection (cid:84) V is non- \u03b2\u2208N(\u03c6)(\u03c3) \u03b2 empty. (cid:92) (cid:92) (cid:92) V = V \u2287 U \u0338= \u2205 \u03b2 \u03c6(\u03b1) \u03b1 \u03b2\u2208N(\u03c6)(\u03c3) \u03b1\u2208\u03c3 \u03b1\u2208\u03c3 Thus, N(\u03c6)(\u03c3) \u2208 N(V). An example of this map between nerves can be seen in Figure 7.7. Proposition 7.34. Let f : X \u2192 Z be some map, and U,V be covers of Z, with \u03c6 : U \u2192 V some map of covers. Then, there exists a map of covers f\u2217(\u03c6) : f\u2217(U) \u2192 f\u2217(V). Recall that f\u2217(U) is the cover of X consisting of the connected components of the pre-images of the sets of U under f. Proof. For every \u03b1, we have U \u2286 V =\u21d2 f\u22121(U ) \u2286 f\u22121(V ). We now need to go \u03b1 \u03c6(\u03b1) \u03b1 \u03c6(\u03b1) from these pre-images to their connected components. Since every connected component of f\u22121(U ) must lie in a unique connected component of f\u22121(V ), our desired map of \u03b1 \u03c6(\u03b1) covers is given by exactly mapping to this connected component. If we have multiple maps of covers, U \u2192 \u03c6 V \u2192 \u03c8 W, we can concatenate the maps, and the f\u2217 function distributes: f\u2217(\u03c8\u25e6\u03c6) = f\u2217(\u03c8)\u25e6f\u2217(\u03c6).

By applying f\u2217 we get a cover tower f\u2217(U) of X. Definition 7.35 (Multiscale Mapper). Let f : X \u2192 Z, U a cover tower of Z. Then, the Multiscale Mapper MM(U,f) is MM(U,f) := N(f\u2217(U)) = {N(f\u2217(U )) | U \u2208 U}) i i together with the induced simplicial maps N(f\u2217(\u03c6 )) : N(f\u2217(U )) \u2192 N(f\u2217(U )). i i i+1 Applying homology, we get the sequence homology groups with induced homo- morphisms between them, i.e., a persistence module: H (N(f\u2217(U ))) N(f \u2212 \u2217( \u2192 \u03c6 1 ))\u2217 ...

As opposed to the normal Mapper, at first glance the Multiscale Mapper adds even more parameters. But a cover tower can be seen as a way of looking at a whole interval of covers. For example, we can get a cover tower by increasing the size of all intervals in an interval cover.
