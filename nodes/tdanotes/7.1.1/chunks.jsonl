Reeb Graphs 7.1.1 Homology of Reeb Graphs The Reeb graph of a topological space X with respect to a function f can be viewed as a summary of X through the lens of f. The natural question is: how good of a summary is it? It is clear that in general we lose information, for example on the dimension of X, but we can still hope that some topological information is retained. In this section, we thus compare the homology of the Reeb graph to the homology of X. Since the Reeb graph R is a graph (a 1-dimensional object), we have H (R ) = 0 for p \u2a7e 2, so f p f any higher-dimensional homology gets lost. However, a graph can still have non-trivial homology in dimensions 0 and 1. Observation 7.8. For a levelset tame f : X \u2192 R, we have \u03b2 (X) = \u03b2 (R ). 0 0 f In other words, the Reeb graph captures the 0-homology of the input space X per- fectly, no matter which levelset tame function f we use. Sadly, the same does not hold for the 1-homology. Let us consider a torus, as in Figure 7.3. In general, it can be that the choice of function f determines whether we capture a hole or not, consider for example a cylinder. However note that for the torus, it is actually the case that no matter which function f we choose, we cannot capture its 1-homology (this is non-trivial to show). f Figure 7.3: The torus and its Reeb graph. On the other hand, we can see that every cycle in the Reeb graph is indeed also a cycle in the topological space X, and it cannot be filled in, so it is indeed a hole. Thus we also get the following observation: Observation 7.9. For a levelset tame f : X \u2192 R, we have \u03b2 (X) \u2a7e \u03b2 (R ). 1 1 f Canwesomehowformalizewhichholeswelose?

Reeb Graphs and Mapper Introduction to TDA Definition 7.10. A p-th homology class h \u2208 H (X) is called horizontal if there is a p finite set of values A = {a ,...,a } such that h \u2208 im(\u03b9 ) where \u03b9 is the map 1 k \u2217 \u2217 (cid:83) H ( X ) \u2192 H (X) induced by inclusion, where X = f\u22121(a). p a\u2208A a p a This definition means that we need to be able to find a finite set of levelsets, such that we can find cycles contained in these levelsets, which are in the homology class h in H (X). p One now wonders whether the set of horizontal homology classes forms a group. Let this set be H (X). It turns out that it is indeed a group. p Lemma 7.11. H (X) is a subgroup of H (X). p p Proof. First, we see that the identity element 0 is in H (X). We can take an arbitrary p set A, and we can always map the 0 element of H ( (cid:83) X ) to 0. p a\u2208A a Next, we show that the set is closed under addition.
