Show that d (T ,T ) = 1 2 I 1 2 d (T ,T ). FD 1 2 Note: we technically only defined d for Reeb graphs. You can simply consider a FD merge tree to be the Reeb graph of itself (with regards to the same filter function). 7.3 Mapper Reeb graphs lose a lot of information, since they at most retain some 1-dimensional holes, butnolargerholes. TogeneralizeReebgraphsfurther, westartlookingatneighborhoods instead of levelsets, which will then lead to the Mapper algorithm. 7.3.1 An Approximation of the Reeb Graph To begin, we consider the 1-dimensional case, and try to find an approximation of the Reeb graph. Instead of looking at pre-images of points, we will now look at pre-images of intervals. Let U = {U } be an open cover of R (i.e., a collection of open sets whose \u03b1 \u03b1\u2208A union is R ). As always, we consider a function f : X \u2192 R . For each f\u22121(U ), we consider \u03b1 a partition into path-connected components, i.e., f\u22121(U ) = (cid:83) V . We then look at f\u2217(U) := {V }, the set of all V we get over all \u03b1. Our \u03b1 object \u03b2 of \u2208B in\u03b1ter \u03b2 est is the nerve of \u03b2 \u03b2 this family, i.e., N(f\u2217(U)). If we take sufficiently nice functions, and sufficiently fine covers, then N(f\u2217(U)) is isomorphic to R . f 7.3.2 Topological Mapper We can generalize this idea to maps to arbitrary spaces. Definition 7.29. Let X,Z be topological spaces. Then we call f : X \u2192 Z well-behaved if for all path-connected open sets U \u2286 Z, f\u22121(U) has finitely many path-connected components. Definition 7.30 (Mapper). Let f : X \u2192 Z be well-behaved, and U be a (finite) open cover of Z. Then the Mapper is defined as M(U,f) := N(f\u2217(U)). As an example, we look at X being the boundary of the 3-cube [0,1]3. We then also look at Z = R2 spanned by the x- and y-axis, with f : X \u2192 Z being the projection onto 1 1 1 this plane. Furthermore, we look at Z = R , spanned by just the x-axis, and f : X \u2192 Z 2 2 2 being again the projection. 84", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "7.3.2"}}
