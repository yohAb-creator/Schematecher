{"chunk_id": "10.5-0", "text": "Introduction to TDA 10.5. Shape Segmentation Figure 10.17: Persistence diagram in dimension 1, computed on 99% of the voting data. One general approach to overcome this issue in many application is the following: compute the density for each data point (e.g., using Gaussian kernel density estimation or any other standard method) and only keep the points with highest density, e.g., remove the 1% with lowest density. Then, compute persistent homology only on the remaining, dense points. Doing this on the voting data, we get the diagram depicted in Figure 10.17. Here we can clearly see a single homology class with long persistence, just as we would expect. 10.5 Shape Segmentation Consider a surface in R3 given as a triangular mesh, that is, by points, edges, and triangles. The goal of shape segmentation is to label different parts of the surface according to what part they are. For example, given a model of a human body, we want to segment it into categories such as \u201chead\u201d, \u201ctorso\u201d or \u201cupper arm\u201d. While this is a well-studied problem in computer graphics, here we sketch a topological approach, described in [3]. We can pick some point on the body, and start growing a ball around it, using the geodesic distance (length of the shortest path along the surface). On the resulting filtration, we can perform persistent homology in dimension 1. If we do this for a point on the palm of a hand, for example, we get a 1-dimensional hole for every finger, see Figure 10.18. If we do this for a point on a finger, the persistence diagram looks very different, see Figure 10.19. We can then classify the persistence diagrams to segment the shape. But, how can we do this? We need to be able to insert persistence diagrams into classical ML pipelines. For this there are several approaches, and we discuss some of them in the next section. 115", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "10.5"}}
