Homology Introduction to TDA The notions of homology we will introduce below actually generalize to any sequence of group homomorphisms \u03b4 that fulfill Lemma 3.20 above. Each such sequence of ho- i momorphisms defines a so-called chain complex: 0 = C (K) \u2212 \u03b4 k\u2192+1 C (K) \u2212 \u03b4 \u2192k C (K)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C (K) \u2212 \u03b4 \u21922 C (K) \u2212 \u03b4 \u21921 C (K) \u2212 \u03b4 \u21920 C = 0 k+1 k k\u22121 2 1 0 \u22121 0 C (K) C (K) C (K) p p\u22121 p\u22122 Figure 3.7: A schematic illustration of a part of a chain complex. 3.2.3 Cycle and Boundary Groups As we already established intuitively, chains without boundaries are called cycles. These are the objects potentially giving rise to holes or cavities. Definition 3.21. A p-chain c is a p-cycle if \u03b4(c) = 0. Z (K) is the p-th cycle group, p consisting of all p-cycles of K. Lemma 3.22. Z (K) is a group. p Proof. Z (K) = ker\u03b4 . (Recall that the kernel of a homomorphism is a subgroup of its p p domain.) So far we have only formally defined a boundary operator, but have not specified which chains we call boundaries. Of course, as already used implicitly before, the bound- aries are the chains that are the result of applying the boundary operator. Definition 3.23. A p-chain c is a p-boundary if \u2203c\u2032 \u2208 C (K) such that \u03b4(c\u2032) = c. p+1 B (K) is the p-th boundary group, consisting of all p-boundaries of K. p Lemma 3.24. B (K) is a group. p Proof.
