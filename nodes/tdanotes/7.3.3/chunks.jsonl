We consider the open cover U of Z : {(\u2212\u221e, 1),(0,1),(2,+\u221e)}. For Z , we consider 2 2 3 3 1 the cover U := U \u00d7U . 1 2 2 Exercise 7.31. (a) Consider spaces X,Z, a filter function f : X \u2192 Z, and an open cover U of Z. Show that if the pullback cover f\u2217(U) is a good cover of X, then M(U,f) is homotopy equivalent to X. (b) Give an example of spaces X,Z, a filter function f : X \u2192 Z, and a good cover U of Z, such that M(U,f) is not homotopy equivalent to X. (c) Give an example of spaces X,Z, a filter function f : X \u2192 Z, and an open cover U of Z such that the pullback cover f\u2217(U) is not a good cover, but M(U,f) is still homotopy equivalent to X. 7.3.3 Mapper for Point Clouds We would like to apply the ideas of the topological Mapper to analyze the shape of data. However, once again we have the issue that data usually does not come in the form of a topological space, but as a set of data points with a notion of distance between them. The Mapper algorithm for point clouds adapts the ideas of the topological Mapper to this setting. Input: In the most general setting, data comes as a finite metric space (P,d ), for ex- P ample as points in Rd or as vertices of a graph. We also require a cover U of a space Z, usually Z = R , as input. Finally, we also need a filter function f : P \u2192 Z and a clustering algorithm (which might also require some input parameters). 85", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "7.3.3"}}
