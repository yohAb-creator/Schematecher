{"chunk_id": "9.1-0", "text": "Chapter 9 Multiparameter persistence This chapter closely follows the introductory paper [2] on multiparameter persis- tence. The interested reader is referred there for a (much) more comprehensive overview of the topic. As we have seen, the persistence modules arising from the \u010cech or Vietoris-Rips com- plexes are stable under small perturbations of the underlying data, but not robust. That is, even a small number of outliers can drastically change the persistence diagram or bar- code. We could try to remedy this problem by making these complexes density-aware in some way. For the Vietoris-Rips complex, a typical way to do this is as follows. For a vertex v in a simplicial complex, its degree deg(v) is the number of edges (1-simplices) in the complex that contain v. Then. for d \u2208 N , the degree-d Vietoris-Rips complex is VRr(X) := {\u03c3 \u2208 VRr(X) : each vertex of \u03c3 has degree at least d}. d Note that vertices corresponding to data points in high-density areas of X will have relatively higher degree, whereas outliers will have relatively lower degree. Thus, for d large enough, we should expect this modification to reduce the impact of outliers. On the other hand, if d is too large, we are \u2018throwing away the baby with the bathwater\u2019. So, the question is: how to choose d? Here, we run into the same issue that originally motivated persistence: there might not be one choice of d that accurately reflects the entire data set. Even if this choice would exist, it might be hard to determine. Instead, we would like to consider all choices of d simultaneously. The solution is to look at persistence w.r.t. both the scale parameter r and the density parameter d at the same time. In this chapter, we formalize such multiparameter persistence, and take a look at the representability and robustness of the resulting multiparameter persistence modules. 9.1 Persistence modules indexed by a poset A persistence module (indexed by R ) consists of a family of vectors spaces U , a \u2208 R , a together with commuting maps U \u2192 U for a \u2a7d b. If we want to define persistence a b 96 Introduction to TDA 9.1. Persistence modules indexed by a poset modules indexed by more exotic sets, we need to first extend the meaning of \u2018\u2a7d\u2019. Definition 9.1. A poset (partially ordered set) is a tuple (P,\u2aaf) consisting of a set P and a binary relation \u2aaf on P satisfying \u2022 a \u2aaf a for all a \u2208 P; \u2022 a \u2aaf b and b \u2aaf a implies a = b for all a,b \u2208 P; \u2022 a \u2aaf b and b \u2aaf c implies a \u2aaf c for all a,b,c \u2208 P; We will sometimes simply write P if the (partial) ordering \u2aaf is clear from context. Note that partial orderings allow for elements to be incomparable, i.e., it can happen for a,b \u2208 P that neither a \u2aaf b nor b \u2aaf a holds. In contrast, under a total ordering all elements in P must be comparable. All the posets we will see in this chapter are constructed from the following examples: \u2022 The reals R = (R,\u2a7d) and natural numbers N = (N,\u2a7d) with their usual ordering are posets. \u2022 If (P,\u2aaf) is a poset, and Q \u2286 P, then (Q,\u2aaf) is a poset; \u2022 For any poset (P,\u2aaf), we have the opposite poset Pop = (P,\u2ab0), where a \u2ab0 b \u21d0\u21d2 b \u2aaf a for all a,b \u2208 P. \u2022 For two posets (P,\u2aaf ) and (Q,\u2aaf ) we have the product poset (P\u00d7Q,\u2aaf), where P", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "9.1"}}
