Find a point set P \u2282 R2 and a radius r such that its Vietoris-Rips \u223c complex has non-trivial 2-homology, i.e., such that H (VR r(P)) \u0338= 0. 2 Furthermore, is there a dimension k such that H (VR r(Q)) = 0 for all k\u2032 \u2a7e k, all k\u2032 r > 0, and all point sets Q \u2282 R2? 5.2 Delaunay and Alpha complexes Recall that computing persistent homology takes O(N3) time, where N is the size of the simplicial complex in the filtration. For large enough radii, both the \u010cech and the Vietoris-Rips complex become complete, and thus contain 2n simplices. Computing persistent homology using those complexes is therefore computationally very expensive, which is why in many applications we would like to have sparser complexes. For data in Rd we can look at the so-called Delaunay triangulation, which only has complexity O(n\u2308d/2\u2309). Definition 5.6. Given a finite point set P \u2282 Rd, a Delaunay simplex is a geometric simplex whose vertices are in P and lie on the boundary of a ball whose interior contains no points of P. A Delaunay triangulation Del(P) of P is a geometric simplicial complex with the vertex set P where every simplex is a Delaunay simplex and whose underlying space covers the convex hull of P. Given a finite point set P \u2282 Rd, the extended Delaunay complex is the simplicial complex where for every face \u03c3, for d\u2032 \u2a7d d, every d\u2032-face of \u03c3 is a Delaunay simplex. It is a well-known fact that for a point set in general position (no d+2 points lie on a common sphere), there is a unique Delaunay triangulation. Furthermore, in this case the extended Delaunay complex and this unique Delaunay triangulation coincide. Definition 5.7. Given a finite point set P \u2282 Rd, the Voronoi diagram is the tessellation of Rd into the Voronoi cells V = {x \u2208 Rd | d(x,p) \u2a7d d(x,q)\u2200q \u2208 P} p for all p \u2208 P. Fact 5.8. The nerve of the Voronoi cells of P is the extended Delaunay complex of P. Exercise 5.9. Convince yourself that for a point set in R2, the nerve of the Voronoi diagram is the extended Delaunay complex. Furthermore, convince yourself that if the points are in general position (there are no three points that are collinear, and no four points that are cocircular), then there is a unique Delaunay triangulation. 57", "rank": 0, "metadata": {"section": "5.2"}}
